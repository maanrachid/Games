The target of the game is to guess the number in 8 Attempts. For each attempts, you will get + for every digit guess in 
its position and - for each digit which is not in its position. for example: if the number is 1345 and you guessed 4371,
then you will get +--. one plus for 3 and two minuses for 1 and 4. 

The game is written using C++ QT.
