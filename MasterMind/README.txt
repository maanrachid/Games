The target of the game is to guess the number in 8 Attempts. For each attempt, you will get + for every digit guessed in 
its position, and - for each digit that is not in its position. 

For example: if the number is 1345 and you guessed 4371,
then you will get +--. one plus for 3 and two minus for 1 and 4. 

The game is written using C++ QT by Maan Haj Rachid.
